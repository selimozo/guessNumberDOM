# Guess Number Game (DOM)
:star: star on github > it motivates. <br><br>
You should ask yourself two questions: <br><br>
<strong>1st one:</strong> How fun can a guessNumber game be? <br><br>
<strong>then 2nd one:</strong> What's more fun than playing guessNumber game?
<br><br>I added some libraries like confetti-js for much more fun (when you win the game effects appear.) and html sanitizer for a bit more security.
Also when you restart website going to have different background color. I tried to make game much more fun that's all. Hope you enjoy it!
